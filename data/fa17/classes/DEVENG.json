Students will explore how to use novel monitoring technologies and \u201cbig data\u201d for  product improvement and evaluation. The student teams will use the case studies (with improvements based on  user feedback and data analysis) to develop a plan for  scaling and evaluation with a rigorous controlled trial.", "priComp": "LEC", "id": 38937, "number": "001", "title": "Design, Evaluate, and Scale Development Technologies", "fExam": {"description": "Yes", "code": "Y"}, "cN": "C200", "status": "A", "grading": "OPT", "sections": [{"type": "LEC", "enrollment": {"wCurr": 0, "eMax": 16, "eMin": 0, "eCurr": 0, "wMax": 10}, "graded": true, "meetings": [{"instructors": [{"role": "1-TIC", "name": "Ashok  Gadgil"}], "loc": {}, "days": {"Mo": true, "Su": false, "We": false, "Th": false, "Sa": false, "Tu": false, "Fr": false}, "eT": "21:29:00", "sT": "18:00:00", "dayAbbrevs": "Mo"}], "isPri": true, "status": {"description": "Open", "code": "O"}, "assocPriSecId": 38937, "id": 38937, "number": "001"}], "crossListed": ["MEC ENG C200"], "instructionMode": "P"}]}

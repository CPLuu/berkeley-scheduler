Students learn to read simple authentic texts such as folk tales, personal letters, forms, and roadside signs. Students continue their study of culturally appropriate behavior in the context of Khmer culture, including notions of \"saving face\" and maintaining social harmony, and how these are expressed in both spoken language and in one's actions.

{"302": {"description": "This course prepares GSIs across the disciplines to teach effective Reading and Composition (R&C) courses. It is intended for experienced GSIs who have already satisfied the Gradute Council's 300-level pedagogy course requirement but who would benefit from specific preparation to teach R&C. Seminar readings, discussions, and assignments provide GSIs with an overview of pedagogical theories and concrete practices that will assist them in designing and teaching R&C courses.

{"375": {"description": "This seminar will introduce graduate students to the theory and practice of teaching and learning in higher education and will prepare new GSIs for the teaching they will do at Berkeley and for the teaching they may do in future careers. The course will provide an introduction to the research on how adults learn and will enable GSIs to select teaching methods that are appropriate to specific courses and educational contexts. The course brings together a cross-disciplinary group of graduate students who will discuss selected texts from the current literature on teaching and learning, experiment with and assess various teaching methods and their impact on learning, and develop professional skills that can be used throughout their careers.

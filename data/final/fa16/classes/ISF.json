Both Weber and Schumpeter display a strong fascination and elaboration with the work of Marx. The way they analyze Marx is very revealing about the way contemporary analysts seek to understand the capitalist system.

We also want to examine the Weberian tradition in terms of the role of culture in shaping economic behavior.
